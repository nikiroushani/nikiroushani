                        <p>Hey there, thanks for visiting my page! My name is Niki Roushani and i’m a Computer Science Student at the University of Queensland. I’m a keen problem solver and lover of design and in the future I see myself in the fields of UX/UI design or Front End Development. </p> <br>
                        <p>While I haven’t recently always been in the tech space, my tech roots run deep. From the age of 11 I was exploring the world of illustration software, playing with free programs like GIMP and InkSpace. At age 12 I was creating digital pamphlets for our family’s local business and by age 13 I discovered the world of website design and development. I was obsessed with creating bright and colourful tumblr blogs, researching how to manipulate the html and css to add fun cursors and hover effects. I would offer free “blog makeovers” to my friends and would spend hours creating different themed websites. My passion for the hobby grew stronger when in my high school IT class they introduced us to Adobe Dreamweaver and I was able to do my hobby for assignment work too. Unfortunately, by the time I started senior school the focus on website development shifted to video game creation, with specific use of the Unreal Development Kit for the senior year curriculum. I no longer found the subject enjoyable and while it was interesting to learn the coding language initially, I was not interested in PC game creation. Being the only the girl in my class, I felt discouraged and opted to study for mathematics, physics and chemistry instead.</p> <br>
                        <p>This route of study ultimately lead me to applying for the Bachelor of Engineering at UQ and by the end of my first semester I had chosen Chemical Engineering as my discipline. I found chemistry and thermodynamics very interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed learning the theoretical content. I had one problem though - I could not envision myself as a Chemical Engineer. Chemical Engineering can be a challenging discipline in itself, the “challenging” is further intensified when you are unsure if it’s the right career path for you. For this reason, after my second year, I decided to take a semester off and re evaluate what I want and where I want to be when I finish university. I took up a job at Optus as a sales assistant and was immediately introduced back into the tech space. A few online coding courses later, I decided to try out some introductory tech courses for the next uni semester and the rest is history. </p> <br>
                        <p>While sitting in a lecture of one of the introductory courses, I made a friend. The next semester, the same friend posted on LinkedIn that she is starting the first women in technology society at UQ. I messaged her immediately to see what I could do to get involved and became an Inaugural Executive. I went from being a girl who felt discouraged in her high school IT class to helping create the first society at UQ championing a community of support for women in tech. Needless to say, it felt pretty full circle. </p> <br>
                        <p>Fast forward to present time, I’m in my penultimate year of Computer Science, with a heavy focus on UX and Web Development subjects. I am always seeking to improve and develop my skills and experience. When I’m not practicing some web dev, you can find me baking delicious treats or making curated playlists on Spotify. I’m also an avid lover of photography, specifically when I’m travelling to cool places (Check out my photos from Iran and Japan below). At the moment, I also work casually at David Jones, where I get to talk to people about clothes (another expensive hobby of mine) and use my design skills to make pretty store displays. I also do some web dev on the side. </p> <br>
