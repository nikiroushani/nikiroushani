More members allow for more funding for events hosted for members whether it be social or professional network events. Additionally, funding from potential sponsorships allows the society to host initiatives such as mentorship programs and career informational sessions. Therefore marketing of the society is crucial in helping the society becoming established and achieving its goals during the first year.</p>

They chose a light pink as a nod to the femininity of the society, a light bulb to signify our acronym "LIT" - for Ladies in Technology and a timeless serif font to tie it all together. From these given materials, the mission was to create a recognisable and professional aesthetic that appeals to both students and potential sponsors.</p>

The society wanted to use its platform to bring like minded people together and help educate and assist them in achieving their goals. We took aesthetic and content inspirations from organisations that had similar initiatives such as @bosswomancollective, who used infographical content to engage their followers.</p>

                        <p class="padding-top">In order to facilitate recognition for the society, a recognisable aesthetic was constructed through the use of chosen fonts, colours and graphics in the societies social media posts and marketing material.  The initial colour additions were a washed out pink, the society's official pink and navy. After using these colours for a short period of time, we determined that the colours made the content feel limited and repetitive and did not communicate to our audience our fresh and exciting message. To remedy this, brighter and diverse colours were added to give our content a brighter, positive feel. The colours that we added were orange, light orange, lilac and a dark pink. </p>

                        <p class="padding-top">Due to the society being unable to interact with its key stakeholders face to face, creating content that helped engage our followers was crucial. We set out a marketing plan and initiative for every semester, which planned and scheduled content to be posted. As well as creating content for our upcoming events, we produced educative content relevant to the tech space and the student experience to help inspire and engage potential members with the society. The visual representation of these posts were also considered in its feed form and posts were specifically designed based on the posts around them, so as to give a sense of consistency and professionalism to the user scrolling through the page.</p>

Eventually the lightbulb became a recurring theme in our marketing, as we incorporated lightbulb graphics in some backgrounds too.</p>
